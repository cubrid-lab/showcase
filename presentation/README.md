# Presentation — CUBRID Python Ecosystem

Slidev-based presentation for the 2026 OSS Developer Contest Finals.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Opens browser with live reload
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build      # Static HTML -> dist/
npm run export     # PDF export
```

## Architecture

- `slides.md` — Narrative + speaker notes (Slidev Markdown)
- `deck.json` — Points to the active metrics snapshot
- `snapshots/*.json` — Immutable metrics snapshots with provenance
- `references.json` — Evidence mapping for claims
- `components/` — Vue components for metrics display + evidence

## Workflow

1. Edit `slides.md` for narrative changes
2. Run `python ../scripts/collect_snapshot.py` to create a new snapshot (when needed)
3. Update `deck.json` to point to the new snapshot
4. Preview with `npm run dev`
5. Build final with `npm run build`
